# Erudit Crowdfunding Campaign

**Go explore** our heritage with an **app that brings history to life** for family learning.

![Erudit banner](./assets/images/banner.webp)

One afternoon, I found my grandson curled up on the couch, **eyes fixed on the television screen. Again.**

> **I don’t always know how to deal with screens**. How to accept them without letting them replace everything else.

When I suggested we go for a walk, he didn’t even answer. It hurt me. I took him with me anyway, and **brought him to a monument** he used to love when he was younger. This time, **he barely looked at it**.

It was in that moment of helplessness that **I noticed a small QR code nearby**. I didn’t realize **it would change our visit** that day.

![What is Erudit ?](./assets/images/title1.webp)

Erudit is a **mobile app** that tells the story of our heritage through animation and music, without words. It combines this with fun quizzes to make our history their own. This approach is designed to **introduce screen time gently**, creating a shared moment between children and parents.

In these **animated stories**, we follow **Eruh & Hudit**, kindhearted grandparents who can travel through time and space. Together with their grandson, they embark on countless adventures that help him learn, grow, and discover the world.

> We choose to **work only with real artists**, whom we proudly feature in the application.

![Why Create Erudit?](./assets/images/title3.webp)

I have always been fascinated by **animated films and series**. Growing up, they were more than just entertainment, they fueled my dreams, gave me strong emotions, and taught me valuable life lessons. Creating my own animated universe has been a lifelong goal.

By focusing on **outdoor landmarks**, I want to use the screen to **reconnect children with the real world** around them.

Think of Erudit as a quiet bench. Sit side-by-side, slow down, and **turn screen time** into a shared moment of discovery and conversation.

> Erudit is the experience we would **love to share with our children**.

### Watch History Come to Life

Visit cultural landmarks, **scan the QR code**, and watch **history come to life** right where it happened.

**For those at home**, Erudit ensures healthy screen time. We offer just **one short story per day**, allowing children to explore history and meaningful life lessons at a gentle pace.

While modern cartoons are often frantic, we choose calmness. **Our shots last at least six seconds**, giving children the time to watch, understand, and stay focused.

</p>

### Review the Story Together

We made the artistic choice of **no voiceovers**. This allows the music to carry the emotion and leaves space for dialogue between you and your child.

After the episode, a **scene-by-scene recap** lets you revisit key moments to ensure the story is fully understood.

</p>

### Play Short Quizzes

Extend the experience with **short, playful quizzes**.

Each question is linked to a visual scene, helping to check understanding and spark meaningful discussion about what you just discovered.

</p>

### Retain Knowledge Forever

To make learning last, Erudit uses **spaced repetition**.

Questions reappear at **smart intervals**, keeping cultural knowledge firmly anchored in your child’s memory.

<br>

</p>

### Plan Your Real-Life Visit

Each story belongs to a **real place**.

With one tap, **locate the landmark** on your map to plan a family outing. Visiting in person **unlocks the site's story**, along with the **untold backstory of our characters**.

<br>

### Enjoy a Safe Experience

We respect your child’s attention. Erudit contains **no ads**, collects **no personal data**, and works **entirely offline**.

It is a safe, private space designed to nurture curiosity, not monetize time.

* **Eruh, the Storyteller:** Storytelling is his passion. His voice carries you away like a melody.
* **Hudit, the Keeper:** Gaming is her passion. She transforms key details into playful quizzes to lock the memory in.

Centuries ago, Eruh and Hudit belonged to a secret ancient order: **The Guardians of Knowledge**.
This order was sworn to protect the stories of the past, ensuring they would never fade away.

They believed that knowledge is a light for the future. A way to avoid past mistakes and pass on values of kindness, wisdom, and respect.

The members of this order possessed a **mysterious power**… but that is for you to discover!
